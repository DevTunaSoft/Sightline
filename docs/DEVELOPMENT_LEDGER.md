# Sightline Development Ledger

**Purpose:** Permanent, evidence-first record enabling developer/AI takeover without relying on chat history. This is **not** a record of work that was only proposed. Always check current GitHub state before updating.

## 2026-11-10 — Documentation baseline (verified)

**Branch:** `main`. **Final documentation commit at this checkpoint:** verify current main SHA at time of use; history includes `79f164a`, `5b1fd05`, `40d9c2d`, `6be9ab3`, `663a5ab`, `40bf54d`, `5ceb3a8`, `f42cb0d`, and `defe90f9`.

**Changes confirmed on GitHub:** added `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF_AND_TAKEOVER.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS_AND_ACCEPTANCE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`; updated `README.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Evidence:** GitHub contents API returned file contents and SHA after writes. This confirms presence, **not** correctness of application behavior.

**Tests:** Application automated suite NOT RUN for these documentation-only commits. Real Windows/Chrome/Edge/Ollama acceptance UNVERIFIED in this checkpoint.

**Outstanding integration:** PR [#6](https://github.com/DevTunaSoft/Sightline/pull/6) is an existing Windows foundation branch targeting `develop`; do not clone its implementation. The source-specific docs in that PR require reconciliation with `main`. Issues [#3](https://github.com/DevTunaSoft/Sightline/issues/3), [#4](https://github.com/DevTunaSoft/Sightline/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/DevTunaSoft/Sightline/issues/5) track real-system browser, Ollama, and Yahoo acceptance.

**Next unblocked tasks:** (1) inspect and reconcile PR #6 docs and current CI evidence, (2) run interactive Windows test on an actual desktop and preserve redacted evidence, (3) build documentation/acceptance CI automation without false PASS claims.

## Mandatory entry template for each meaningful checkpoint

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC — <short title>
- Repository / branch / exact commit SHA / PR / issue:
- Requirement IDs:
- Baseline inspected (branches, PRs, workflows, source paths):
- Changes (paths and behavior):
- Commands run and environment:
- Tests: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / NOT RUN / UNVERIFIED, counts, evidence URL:
- Security/privacy checks:
- Resource measurements (duration, samples, RAM, CPU, handles, threads):
- Root cause and regression evidence:
- Known gaps and blockers (category, owner, reproduction):
- Next three unblocked tasks with exact recovery commands:
```

Rules: Append rather than erase prior history. Distinguish historical CI claims from independently rerun tests. Never paste credentials, raw sensitive logs or user data. Close/open issues based on demonstrated acceptance; avoid duplicates. Two identical unsuccessful attempts require change of strategy or explicit blocker.
